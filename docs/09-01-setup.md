# Part 1: Setup

## Task 3.01 Delete Front Matter

*Delete unnecessary front matter*

Delete everything in the downloaded text up to the title. Your new document should begin with the title of the work.

## Task 3.02 Delete End Matter

*Delete unnecessary end matter*

Using your find tool, search for END OF THIS PROJECT and find the line that looks like this:

<code>END OF THIS</code>

If that does not work, try:

<code>*** END</code>

If that does not work, scroll to the end and then scroll back up to locate the start of the end matter.

Delete that line and all the remaining lines of the document. Your new document should end with the last line of the original work and should not include any of the Project Gutenberg legalese that one normally finds at the end.

*Eliminate unnecessary paragraph markers*

Using your find and replace tools, reformat the e-book to eliminate unnecessary paragraph markers and to permit the text to wrap until it hits an actual paragraph mark.
