Here is the [PowerPoint file that I used in class](https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/8f9c1dbd-3e27-400a-bdae-29608fa12361/misc-screenshots/formatting-functions-formulas.pptx). I needed to work on it today and make it more usable.

To see the class videos, go to the Sakai calendar for the day and session for your recitation to find the links and passcodes.
