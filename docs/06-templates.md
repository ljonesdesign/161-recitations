# Templates

## Wrap up 02.02 Task

If you are still having issues with this task, please try to get up a bit early and work with me before class or meet with me after class. I can spend a few minutes of class time on simple issues, but if you are dealing with a complex problem, we will need to meet after class or set up office hours.

If you need a review, look over the the Sep 07 CSS class notes (link in left sidebar). We all missed this class due to the Labor Day Holiday. If you need to look at the videos again, go to the class entry [in the calendar](https://sakai.unc.edu/x/LOzYFh) to access the videos. *You will default to the current week, so go to the previous week.*


## Choosing a Template

By now you should understand the basic HTML structure and how CSS is used to make the basic HTML more visually pleasing. I have a bias towards using themes that will work on phones. I would encourage you to look for keywords that mention "mobile", "responsive" or "mobile friendly" associated with your choice of a theme.

Take a look at the following code and note the commments:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang ="en"> <!-- english language attribute added -->

  <head>

    <!-- utf-8 character set helps browser display text correctly -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">

    <!--  this view port setting makes for better display on mobile devices -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <!--  link assumes you have a stylesheet containing styles in a directory named styles -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css">


    <title>Student Name | Home Page</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>Welcome to my webpage! This is my only page. This is not an website.</p>
  </body>
</html>

```

!> your home page, or initial page should always be named **index.html**. the "i" should be lower case and html should be lowercase. Don't name it **index1.html** or **2index.html**. Don't ever have a page named **home.html**. Your **home** page **is** the **index.html** page.

## Working with Templates

Here are a few examples of my own templates that some students have used from past classes (these have the mobile friendly settings in the ```<head>```).

* [One page template sample](https://opal.ils.unc.edu/~lblakej/website-helps/02-one-page-final-sample/)
* [Multiple page template sample](https://opal.ils.unc.edu/~lblakej/website-helps/05-multi-page-final-sample/)
* [Background Photo Sample](https://opal.ils.unc.edu/~lblakej/website-helps/08-example/about.php)
* [UNC Theme Sample](https://opal.ils.unc.edu/~lblakej/website-helps/07-NEW-bootstrap-template/index.html)

Some students have also used templates from the [sources on the class web site](https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2020_fall/inls161_001/06a.01.preps.html).

In class we will download some different themes and discuss all of elements that you will need to include in your website to earn full points. The class will be recorded.
