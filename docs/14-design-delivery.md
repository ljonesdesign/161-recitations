# Design & Delivery

This is still incomplete... but everthing here is good.

## Presentation Checklist

> Carefully following the grading rubric allows you to do very well on this project, even if you are not a great designer or storyteller!

!>Failure to follow the grading rubric might result in a poor grade even if you are an exceptionally good designer and storyteller. **Takeaway: Don't assume that your advanced presentation skills will hit everything on the rubric. Read the requirements.**

1. Choose a Theme that works with your topic. **Something New** grade means you are using a custom theme or you have changed a theme that no longer is recognizable as a common PowerPoint theme. I will demo some very simple strategies on how to do this.
2. Put in the first slide notes why you chose your theme. (*This is a good choice for my topic because...*)
3. Use default bullet format for **ONLY the overview and summary slides**. (5 points off for each additional bullet-centric slide).
4. Add automatically updated date to footer component in master slide.
5. Start with a title slide.
6. Include overview slide with main points.
7. Include requisite slides covering points on overview slide.
8. Include summary slide recapping main points.
9. One slide with different background. (can be hidden slide).
10. Optional: include a navigational device that shows the viewer the progress of the presentation.
11. **Use pictures/graphics/photos as the primary focus of your presentation**. At least one should be from the web and include credit for it.
12. Add text or graphics to at least one of the pictures. (for explanatory purposes).
13. Animation. Make something **appear**.
14. Animation. Make something **disappear**.
15. Have at least one visual **slide transition**.
16. *Commonly overlooked item:* **Hide** at least **one slide**. **Link to** the **hidden** slide **from** a **non-hidden** slide. Slide prior to hidden slide is best.
17. *Commonly overlooked item:* **Link back** to the **presentation from** the **hidden** slide. (Go back the the slide you came from.)
18. **Link** at least **one object** to external **webpage** outside of the presentation.
19. Add **narration** to the presentation. Presentation should be able to run unattended.
20. Slide show is a well-organized, logically-connected presentation of a topic.
21. Formatting from slide to slide is consistent.
22. Slides are easy to read and presentation friendly.
23. Use the speaker's notes to discuss the creative decisions you used. Not required for each slide. Does not need to be verbose.
