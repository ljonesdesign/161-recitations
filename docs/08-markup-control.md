[Project Gutenberg Newest Releases](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=release_date) Here is a list of the latest 1,000 recent additions. It's kind of fascinating to see what volunteers have been working on over the last six months. Find anything that you like but you should not go for books with more than 15 chapters.

## New Macintosh Setup Videos
The most frustrating part of this project for Mac Users is the setup because the user interface is very different from the PC demonstration. If you are Mac User you should [watch this video for set up](https://opal.ils.unc.edu/~lblakej/task03-mac-video/macsetup.mp4) and not try to follow along with the PC demo in class.

## Videos from Previous Class
In Spring of 2019 I developed an entire course of video lectures for this project. If you want to see the video lectures then you can view them here: <https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2019_spring/inls161_001/03/03b-windows-part-1-setup.php> You are also welcome to use  a grade sheet that is number referenced to these video lectures or the gradeshet without number references.
