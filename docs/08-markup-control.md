[Thursday's Lecture Page](https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2020_fall/inls161_001/08a.01.preps.html)

This recitation is geared towards helping you get your project done. The Lecture on Thursday will give you more context about why you are doing what you are doing.

You are going to need to choose a book. I prefer that you stay away from classic popular books simply because I am weary of grading them. But if you must choose a popular book I will grade it.

[Project Gutenberg Newest Releases](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=release_date) Here is a list of the latest 1,000 recent additions. It's kind of fascinating to see what volunteers have been working on over the last six months. Find anything that you like but you should **not go for books with fewer that 8 chapters or more than 15 chapters ** and stay away from oddly formatted text or poetry. You want clean blocks of text; You will not attempt to include any graphics or photos from the book, so you should stay away from books that are mostly graphically in nature. It is okay to choose a book with some photos, but the text format you choose will not have the photos included.

## New Macintosh Setup Videos
The most frustrating part of this project for Mac Users is the setup because the user interface is very different from the PC demonstration. If you are Mac User you should [watch this video for set up](https://opal.ils.unc.edu/~lblakej/task03-mac-video/macsetup.mp4) and not try to follow along with the PC demo in class.

## Videos from Previous Class
In Spring of 2019 I developed an entire course of video lectures for this project. If you want to see the video lectures then you can view them here: <https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2019_spring/inls161_001/03/03b-windows-part-1-setup.php> You are also welcome to use  a grade sheet that is number referenced to these video lectures or the grade sheet without number references.
