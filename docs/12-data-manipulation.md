# Data Manipulation

>At the bottom of this page are some links to sorts and filters from past classes (if you want to get an overview before class).

## SORT: single level

<ol>
	<li>Sort the data rows on the <span class="attention"><span style="background-color:#f1c40f">15-sort NC ZIP codes</span></span> worksheet by <span class="spreadsheets2">ZIP Code</span>.</li>
	<li>Have the sort display from smallest to the largest.</li>
</ol>


<h2>SORT:&nbsp; multi-level</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Sort the data rows on the <span class="attention"><span style="background-color:#f1c40f">06-VA-Religion</span></span> worksheet</li>
	<li>first by <span class="spreadsheets2">Sikh</span> from LARGEST to smallest,</li>
	<li>and then by <span class="spreadsheets2">Catholic</span> from SMALLEST to largest.</li>
</ol>


<div class="w3-card w3-container w3-margin-bottom w3-white">
<h2>FILTER: single level</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Filter the data on the <span class="attention"><span style="background-color:#f1c40f">17-Filter Disabled Workers</span></span> worksheet&nbsp; to find the <span class="spreadsheets2">bottom three Congressional Districts</span> in terms of <span class="spreadsheets2">Disabled Workers</span></li>
	<li>Do not sort the results. Simply show the results of filtering out all but the bottom three districts.
</ol>
</div>

<div class="w3-card w3-container w3-margin-bottom w3-white">
<h2>FILTER: multi-level</h2>

<h3>Demonstrate facility with a number filter, after having used an exclusion filter to show only one subset of data&nbsp;</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Use a multilevel filter on the <span class="attention"><span style="background-color:#f1c40f">18-Language Preferences</span></span> worksheet to find out which of the languages whose names start <span class="spreadsheets2">with the letter A only</span></li>
	<li>had <span class="spreadsheets2">Receipt Count (excluding 53rd week) between 1000 and 4000</span></li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="w3-card w3-container w3-margin-bottom w3-white">
<h3>Again, demonstrate facility with a number filter, after having used an exclusion filter to show only one subset of data&nbsp;</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Use a multilevel filter on the <span class="attention"><span style="background-color:#f1c40f">19-Year&amp;ResidentialCustomer</span></span> worksheet to find out which of the <span class="spreadsheets2">Month of PeriodEndDate</span> only in <span class="spreadsheets2">March</span></li>
	<li>had an <span class="spreadsheets2">above average ResidentialCustomerCount</span></li>
</ol>


<p>(In the video I say there is only 53 rows of data, but that is because the zoom share screen was obscuring the &quot;2&quot; in 253. There are around 253 rows of data including the headers.)</p>

## PIVOT TABLE

Too much detail on this page to condense here so here is the link to the [Pivot Table Task on Class Web Page](https://ils.unc.edu/courses/2020_spring/inls161_001/13b.03.pivot-tables.html)

Here is [video from last spring](https://opal.ils.unc.edu/~lblakej/task04-videos/pivot-table-video.mp4)

Optional videos: These are supplemental videos that were used in past classes. Concepts are similar, but the data is different.
