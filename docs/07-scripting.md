NEW!<a href="../../html-help/">Here is a section where I will have html help information</a>

## Client Side Script (JavaScript)

<p>I will demonstrate how you can implement some of these javascript samples shown here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_examples.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_examples.asp</a></p>

<p>We do not expect you to learn how to program in javascript in a part of one lecture and lab. We just want you to be able to grab some code and make it work for you.</p>

<p>If you are interested in actually understanding some javascript, then you may want to invest 12 minutes here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ukg_U3CnJWI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ukg_U3CnJWI</a></p>

<p>Certainly one of the javascript examples from w3schools demos will to the job for your project. You should not just copy and paste it as is; you should make it work to suit your situation.</p>

<p>Below is an example screen shot of how I did this for my  <a href="../../02-one-page-final-sample/">one page site</a>(follow the link and scroll to the bottom and you can see the live example):</p>

<div style="border-style:solid;border-color:#000;"><img class="img-fluid" src="javascript.png" alt="javascript example screenshot"></div>


<br><p><strong>That is the real learning objective: figure out how to do a little JavaScript hacking to make it work for you.</strong></p>

<p>For example, if you choose <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_intro_lightbulb">this sample</a>, donâ€™t just use the same image</a>; use your own images. Students have figured this out over and over again, so you can do it too. <em>I have had to sit down and help some students that got stuck, so let me know if you need some extra help.</em></p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Server Side Script (Google Font example)</h2>

<p>Here is a link that describes how to integrated Google fonts into your site:</p>

<p>There are other Server side scripts you can implement, but the Google fonts option is used by a lot of students to meet the server side script.</p>
