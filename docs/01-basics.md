# Basics

## First tool: Browser
Its good to download Chrome and Firefox for web development purposes. These both work on Macs and PC, and they are not specific to Mac or PC operating system. It's okay to use Safari and Windows browsers such as Edge and Internet Explorer for your personal browsing. I will be using Chrome for class demonstrations.

## Calendar
This is where you can find the links for zoom meetings throughout the semester.
